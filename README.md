# Bignum arithmetic experiments

## Description

This repository is made for experiments implemented in Python, comparing floating-point algorithms and algorithms with bignum arithmetic that can mitigate floating-point error.

## Results

The results showed that bignum arithmetic is indeed able to mitigate floating point error if accuracy is much more important than performance. Performance can be improved by optimizing Python bignum arithmetic.
